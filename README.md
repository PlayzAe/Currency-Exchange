# An Exchange Currency App

I‚Äôm building a currency converter app with C# and Windows Forms that lets you easily convert different currencies. Right now, it‚Äôs all about basic conversions, but I‚Äôm planning to add a sign-up and login system soon. This is a long-term project, so stay tuned for more updates!

# Purpose

The currency converter app helps you quickly and accurately convert between different currencies. Built with C# and Windows Forms, it's designed to be user-friendly and efficient. The app will evolve to include features like user sign-up and login. This project aims to offer a seamless and reliable conversion experience. Stay tuned for ongoing improvements!

**Features:**

- Simple and intuitive currency conversion interface.
- Real-time exchange rates for accurate calculations.
- Easy-to-use input and output fields.
- Plans to add user accounts with sign-up and login capabilities.
- Ongoing updates and enhancements for a better experience.


## Optimizations

I made some tweaks to improve how events are handled, buttons look, and how the app manages different pages, making the interface smoother. I made sure only the "Send Money" and "Resources" page opens in a separate window and that resources are used efficiently. I will continue to push updates like once every week and be improving the overall quality of the application. This setup only works on Windows because it relies on Windows Forms, so it won‚Äôt run on other platforms like macOS, Linux, web browsers, Android, or iOS since it depends on Windows-specific UI and event handling.

## Additional GitHub Profile Details

üë©‚Äçüíª I'm currently still working on this currency converter long term

üß† I'm currently learning about backend and how to handle user's data from a login in and sign up page

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact about this project is that working on this currency exchange app is quite an experience! I faced some amusing challenges with button interactions and UI elements, leading to entertaining debugging sessions. Each problem I solved taught me something new about coding, turning the development process into a mini-adventure as I fine-tuned every detail to perfection!
